call
me
ishmael
some
years
ago—never
mind
how
long
precisely—having
little
or
no
money
in
my
purse
and
nothing
particular
to
interest
me
on
shore
i
thought
i
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
watery
part
of
the
world
it
is
a
way
i
have
of
driving
off
the
spleen
and
regulating
the
circulation
whenever
i
find
myself
growing
grim
about
the
mouth
whenever
it
is
a
damp
drizzly
november
in
my
soul
whenever
i
find
myself
involuntarily
pausing
before
coffin
warehouses
and
bringing
up
the
rear
of
every
funeral
i
meet
and
especially
whenever
my
hypos
get
such
an
upper
hand
of
me
that
it
requires
a
strong
moral
principle
to
prevent
me
from
deliberately
stepping
into
the
street
and
methodically
knocking
people's
hats
off—then
i
account
it
high
time
to
get
to
sea
as
soon
as
i
can
this
is
my
substitute
for
pistol
and
ball
with
a
philosophical
flourish
cato
throws
himself
upon
his
sword
i
quietly
take
to
the
ship
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
if
they
but
knew
it
almost
all
men
in
their
degree
some
time
or
other
cherish
very
nearly
the
same
feelings
towards
the
ocean
with
methere
now
is
your
insular
city
of
the
manhattoes
belted
round
by
wharves
as
indian
isles
by
coral
reefs—commerce
surrounds
it
with
her
surf
right
and
left
the
streets
take
you
waterward
its
extreme
downtown
is
the
battery
where
that
noble
mole
is
washed
by
waves
and
cooled
by
breezes
which
a
few
hours
previous
were
out
of
sight
of
land
look
at
the
crowds
of
water-gazers
therecircumambulate
the
city
of
a
dreamy
sabbath
afternoon
go
from
corlears
hook
to
coenties
slip
and
from
thence
by
whitehall
northward
what
do
you
see
—posted
like
silent
sentinels
all
around
the
town
stand
thousands
upon
thousands
of
mortal
men
fixed
in
ocean
reveries
some
leaning
against
the
spiles
some
seated
upon
the
pier-heads
some
looking
over
the
bulwarks
of
ships
from
china
some
high
aloft
in
the
rigging
as
if
striving
to
get
a
still
better
seaward
peep
but
these
are
all
landsmen
of
week
days
pent
up
in
lath
and
plaster—tied
to
counters
nailed
to
benches
clinched
to
desks
how
then
is
this
are
the
green
fields
gone
what
do
they
herebut
look
here
come
more
crowds
pacing
straight
for
the
water
and
seemingly
bound
for
a
dive
strange
nothing
will
content
them
but
the
extremest
limit
of
the
land
loitering
under
the
shady
lee
of
yonder
warehouses
will
not
suffice
no
they
must
get
just
as
nigh
the
water
as
they
possibly
can
without
falling
in
and
there
they
stand—miles
of
them—leagues
inlanders
all
they
come
from
lanes
and
alleys
streets
and
avenues—north
east
south
and
west
yet
here
they
all
unite
tell
me
does
the
magnetic
virtue
of
the
needles
of
the
compasses
of
all
those
ships
attract
them
thitheronce
more
say
you
are
in
the
country
in
some
high
land
of
lakes
take
almost
any
path
you
please
and
ten
to
one
it
carries
you
down
in
a
dale
and
leaves
you
there
by
a
pool
in
the
stream
there
is
magic
in
it
let
the
most
absent-minded
of
men
be
plunged
in
his
deepest
reveries—stand
that
man
on
his
legs
set
his
feet
a-going
and
he
will
infallibly
lead
you
to
water
if
water
there
be
in
all
that
region
should
you
ever
be
athirst
in
the
great
american
desert
try
this
experiment
if
your
caravan
happen
to
be
supplied
with
a
metaphysical
professor
yes
as
every
one
knows
meditation
and
water
are
wedded
for
everbut
here
is
an
artist
he
desires
to
paint
you
the
dreamiest
shadiest
quietest
most
enchanting
bit
of
romantic
landscape
in
all
the
valley
of
the
saco
what
is
the
chief
element
he
employs
there
stand
his
trees
each
with
a
hollow
trunk
as
if
a
hermit
and
a
crucifix
were
within
and
here
sleeps
his
meadow
and
there
sleep
his
cattle
and
up
from
yonder
cottage
goes
a
sleepy
smoke
deep
into
distant
woodlands
winds
a
mazy
way
reaching
to
overlapping
spurs
of
mountains
bathed
in
their
hill-side
blue
but
though
the
picture
lies
thus
tranced
and
though
this
pine-tree
shakes
down
its
sighs
like
leaves
upon
this
shepherd's
head
yet
all
were
vain
unless
the
shepherd's
eye
were
fixed
upon
the
magic
stream
before
him
go
visit
the
prairies
in
june
when
for
scores
on
scores
of
miles
you
wade
knee-deep
among
tiger-lilies—what
is
the
one
charm
wanting
—water—there
is
not
a
drop
of
water
there
were
niagara
but
a
cataract
of
sand
would
you
travel
your
thousand
miles
to
see
it
why
did
the
poor
poet
of
tennessee
upon
suddenly
receiving
two
handfuls
of
silver
deliberate
whether
to
buy
him
a
coat
which
he
sadly
needed
or
invest
his
money
in
a
pedestrian
trip
to
rockaway
beach
why
is
almost
every
robust
healthy
boy
with
a
robust
healthy
soul
in
him
at
some
time
or
other
crazy
to
go
to
sea
why
upon
your
first
voyage
as
a
passenger
did
you
yourself
feel
such
a
mystical
vibration
when
first
told
that
you
and
your
ship
were
now
out
of
sight
of
land
why
did
the
old
persians
hold
the
sea
holy
why
did
the
greeks
give
it
a
separate
deity
and
own
brother
of
jove
surely
all
this
is
not
without
meaning
and
still
deeper
the
meaning
of
that
story
of
narcissus
who
because
he
could
not
grasp
the
tormenting
mild
image
he
saw
in
the
fountain
plunged
into
it
and
was
drowned
but
that
same
image
we
ourselves
see
in
all
rivers
and
oceans
it
is
the
image
of
the
ungraspable
phantom
of
life
and
this
is
the
key
to
it
allnow
when
i
say
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
going
to
sea
whenever
i
begin
to
grow
hazy
about
the
eyes
and
begin
to
be
over
conscious
of
my
lungs
i
do
not
mean
to
have
it
inferred
that
i
ever
go
to
sea
as
a
passenger
for
to
go
as
a
passenger
you
must
needs
have
a
purse
and
a
purse
is
but
a
rag
unless
you
have
something
in
it
besides
passengers
get
sea-sick—grow
quarrelsome—don't
sleep
of
nights—do
not
enjoy
themselves
much
as
a
general
thing
—no
i
never
go
as
a
passenger
nor
though
i
am
something
of
a
salt
do
i
ever
go
to
sea
as
a
commodore
or
a
captain
or
a
cook
i
abandon
the
glory
and
distinction
of
such
offices
to
those
who
like
them
for
my
part
i
abominate
all
honorable
respectable
toils
trials
and
tribulations
of
every
kind
whatsoever
it
is
quite
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
take
care
of
myself
without
taking
care
of
ships
barques
brigs
schooners
and
what
not
and
as
for
going
as
cook
—though
i
confess
there
is
considerable
glory
in
that
a
cook
being
a
sort
of
officer
on
ship-board—yet
somehow
i
never
fancied
broiling
fowls
—though
once
broiled
judiciously
buttered
and
judgmatically
salted
and
peppered
there
is
no
one
who
will
speak
more
respectfully
not
to
say
reverentially
of
a
broiled
fowl
than
i
will
it
is
out
of
the
idolatrous
dotings
of
the
old
egyptians
upon
broiled
ibis
and
roasted
river
horse
that
you
see
the
mummies
of
those
creatures
in
their
huge
bake-houses
the
pyramidsno
when
i
go
to
sea
i
go
as
a
simple
sailor
right
before
the
mast
plumb
down
into
the
forecastle
aloft
there
to
the
royal
mast-head
true
they
rather
order
me
about
some
and
make
me
jump
from
spar
to
spar
like
a
grasshopper
in
a
may
meadow
and
at
first
this
sort
of
thing
is
unpleasant
enough
it
touches
one's
sense
of
honor
particularly
if
you
come
of
an
old
established
family
in
the
land
the
van
rensselaers
or
randolphs
or
hardicanutes
and
more
than
all
if
just
previous
to
putting
your
hand
into
the
tar-pot
you
have
been
lording
it
as
a
country
schoolmaster
making
the
tallest
boys
stand
in
awe
of
you
the
transition
is
a
keen
one
i
assure
you
from
a
schoolmaster
to
a
sailor
and
requires
a
strong
decoction
of
seneca
and
the
stoics
to
enable
you
to
grin
and
bear
it
but
even
this
wears
off
in
timewhat
of
it
if
some
old
hunks
of
a
sea-captain
orders
me
to
get
a
broom
and
sweep
down
the
decks
what
does
that
indignity
amount
to
weighed
i
mean
in
the
scales
of
the
new
testament
do
you
think
the
archangel
gabriel
thinks
anything
the
less
of
me
because
i
promptly
and
respectfully
obey
that
old
hunks
in
that
particular
instance
who
ain't
a
slave
tell
me
that
well
then
however
the
old
sea-captains
may
order
me
about—however
they
may
thump
and
punch
me
about
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
it
is
all
right
that
everybody
else
is
one
way
or
other
served
in
much
the
same
way—either
in
a
physical
or
metaphysical
point
of
view
that
is
and
so
the
universal
thump
is
passed
round
and
all
hands
should
rub
each
other's
shoulder-blades
and
be
contentagain
i
always
go
to
sea
as
a
sailor
because
they
make
a
point
of
paying
me
for
my
trouble
whereas
they
never
pay
passengers
a
single
penny
that
i
ever
heard
of
on
the
contrary
passengers
themselves
must
pay
and
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
paying
and
being
paid
the
act
of
paying
is
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
infliction
that
the
two
orchard
thieves
entailed
upon
us
but
being
paid
—what
will
compare
with
it
the
urbane
activity
with
which
a
man
receives
money
is
really
marvellous
considering
that
we
so
earnestly
believe
money
to
be
the
root
of
all
earthly
ills
and
that
on
no
account
can
a
monied
man
enter
heaven
ah
how
cheerfully
we
consign
ourselves
to
perditionfinally
i
always
go
to
sea
as
a
sailor
because
of
the
wholesome
exercise
and
pure
air
of
the
fore-castle
deck
for
as
in
this
world
head
winds
are
far
more
prevalent
than
winds
from
astern
(that
is
if
you
never
violate
the
pythagorean
maxim)
so
for
the
most
part
the
commodore
on
the
quarter-deck
gets
his
atmosphere
at
second
hand
from
the
sailors
on
the
forecastle
he
thinks
he
breathes
it
first
but
not
so
in
much
the
same
way
do
the
commonalty
lead
their
leaders
in
many
other
things
at
the
same
time
that
the
leaders
little
suspect
it
but
wherefore
it
was
that
after
having
repeatedly
smelt
the
sea
as
a
merchant
sailor
i
should
now
take
it
into
my
head
to
go
on
a
whaling
voyage
this
the
invisible
police
officer
of
the
fates
who
has
the
constant
surveillance
of
me
and
secretly
dogs
me
and
influences
me
in
some
unaccountable
way—he
can
better
answer
than
any
one
else
and
doubtless
my
going
on
this
whaling
voyage
formed
part
of
the
grand
programme
of
providence
that
was
drawn
up
a
long
time
ago
it
came
in
as
a
sort
of
brief
interlude
and
solo
between
more
extensive
performances
i
take
it
that
this
part
of
the
bill
must
have
run
something
like
this"grand
contested
election
for
the

of
